# Spine Soothe - A Demo Rule Based Expert System Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
This Python program serves as a Demo to the working of an expert system for providing personalized recommendations for back pain relief exercises based on the location of the pain. It utilizes a rule-based approach to match the user's input location with predefined exercise rules stored in the knowledge base.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Features:

Personalized Exercise Recommendations: Users can input the location of their back pain (upper/middle/lower/full), and the system recommends specific exercises tailored to that location.
Exercise Descriptions: Along with exercise recommendations, the system provides descriptions of the suggested exercises to guide users in performing them correctly.
Dynamic Exercise Links: The system supports exercise descriptions containing URLs, allowing users to directly access instructional videos or additional resources for each recommended exercise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dependencies:

Python 3.x
webbrowser module (standard library)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Instructions:

Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the prompts to input the location of your back pain (upper/middle/lower/full).
After providing the location, the system suggests a specific exercise and displays its description.
If an exercise description contains a URL, it will automatically open in your default web browser for further reference.
